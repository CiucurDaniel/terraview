# About DOT and Terraform 

This DOT format represents a directed graph, where nodes represent Terraform resources and the edges represent dependencies between those resources. The graph is hierarchical, with the "root" node at the top representing the top-level Terraform configuration. Here's a breakdown of the DOT format:

compound = "true": Indicates that the graph is compound, meaning it has nested subgraphs.
newrank = "true": Indicates that nodes within the same rank are in the same subgraph.
Now, let's interpret the graph:

Nodes: Each node represents a Terraform resource or provider.
Nodes are labeled with the resource/provider type and its name or identifier.
The shape of the node represents the type of resource/provider.
Edges: Each edge represents a dependency between resources/providers.
An edge from node A to node B means that resource B depends on resource A.
In this graph, edges indicate the relationships between resources, such as a VM depending on a network interface.
Subgraph: The "root" subgraph contains all the nodes and edges.
The "root" subgraph is compound, meaning it contains nested subgraphs representing dependencies.
Specific to Terraform:

Provider: The provider node represents the Terraform provider used in the configuration.
Resource: Each resource node represents a Terraform resource defined in the configuration.
Dependency: The direction of the edges indicates the dependency relationship between resources. For example, a VM resource depends on a network interface resource, so there is an edge from the VM node to the network interface node.
Overall, this DOT format visually represents the dependency graph of the Terraform configuration, helping you understand the relationships between resources and the order in which they are created or destroyed during Terraform execution.
